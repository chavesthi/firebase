# **App Name**: FervoFinder

## Core Features:

- Unified Login: Implement a shared login screen for both users and partners, with color-coded panels (blue for users, red for partners) to differentiate roles.
- Interactive Event Map: Display an interactive map centered on the user's real-time location, with event locations overlaid as tappable icons corresponding to event types.
- Venue Registration: Enable partners to register their venue by inputting an address, using geocoding to fix the location on the map and associate it with a venue type (Nightclub, Bar, etc.) represented by distinct icons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Transparent or very light overlay to keep the map visible.
- Neon Blue (#7DF9FF), Neon Red (#FF4136), and Neon Purple (#D400FF) for a vibrant, nightlife-themed interface.
- Neon Green (#1F51FF) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Custom icons representing event types (Nightclub, Bar, Stand-up, etc.) to be used on the map and in filters. Each icon should use the primary neon colors.
- Map-centric design, ensuring the map is always prominent and not obscured by other UI elements. Filters and event details should overlay or slide in without covering the entire map.
